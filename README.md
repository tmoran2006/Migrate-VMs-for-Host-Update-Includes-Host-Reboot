This is a script the was developed in order to assist in mostly automation of the migration of VMs as well as rebooting of the host machine after the update to the ESXi Hosts has completed.

This script runs in the environment I have access too.  You should check and double check if this will work in your environment before running.  I am not to be held responsible for any issues that may arise from running this code.
